# screenRecorder
records audio and video with tkinter GUI

One day my mom asked me to download a screen recorder for her Zoom meetings.
I asked myself, why to download one if I can learn about it and then build it?

This project can record audio and video *individually* (but can record simultaneously) - You can record just the audio if you want to.

Enjoy!
